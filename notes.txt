I faced some issues in pushing the code into github. Because i created a Read.me file. It fixed by

git pull origin main --rebase

Part 1: Set up Multiple Authentication and Admin Dashboard User Interface

didn't get a suggestion to use auth breeze vue with inertia and pestunit

so manually installed all these

composer require laravel/jetstream
php artisan jetstream:install inertia
npm install && npm run build
php artisan migrate


php artisan migrate:fresh  - to migrate files as fresh.
